When we create a new world, we fill it with cells. Every time we click a button in the application, a new cell is added to the list of cells:
- it can be either alive or dead;
- life is born if a living cell is created three times in a row;
- if a dead cell is born three times in a row, the life nearby dies.

Initially, the list of cells is empty.
